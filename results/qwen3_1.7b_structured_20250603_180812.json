Rule 1 says emergency_replacement includes \"can't work\", \"sick\", \"replace\", etc. So yes, that fits.\n\nNext, the entities. The employee name is Sarah.

The time period is \"tomorrow\" as well.

The user provided the input \"Wer ist heute verfügbar?\" which is a German question asking \"Who is available today?\" So, I need to parse this into the specified JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll check the intent. The question is about availability, so looking at the classification rules, the closest one is \"information\" since it's asking for available employees. But wait, the options include \"view_schedule\" which is about seeing the schedule. However, the question is more about availability rather than viewing a schedule. So maybe \"information\" is more appropriate here.\n\nNext, the entities. The user is asking who is available today. The entity \"shift_day\" should be \"today\". The \"time_period\" would be \"today\" as well. The \"urgency\" might be \"planned\" since it's about availability, but the classification rules mention \"emergency\" for can't work, but this is about availability, not necessarily emergency. So maybe \"planned\" here.\n\nLooking at the entities, the \"employee_name\" is not present because the question doesn't specify a particular name. So that's null. The \"shift_time\" is null because the question doesn't mention a specific time. \"Optimization_preference\" is also null since there's no mention of optimization. The confidence would be 0.0 since there's missing info.\n\nThe suggested question would be the original input, but the user wants the JSON only. So the \"suggested_question\" is \"Wer ist heute verfügbar?\".\n\nWait, the output format requires the \"intent\" to be one of the categories. The classification rules have \"information\" as an option. So the intent is \"information\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the intent as \"information\", entities with shift_day as \"today\", time_period as \"today\", urgency as \"planned\" (since it's about availability, but the classification rules for \"information\" don't have urgency. Hmm, maybe \"urgency\" is null here. Wait, the rules say \"urgency\" is \"emergency\" or \"planned\" if the question is about availability. But the classification rules for \"information\" don't have urgency. So maybe \"urgency\" is null here.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"information\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": null,\n    \"shift_day\": \"today\",\n    \"shift_time\": null,\n    \"optimization_preference\": null,\n    \"time_period\": \"today\",\n    \"urgency\": null\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"missing_info\": [\"employee_name\", \"shift_time\", \"optimization_preference\"],\n  \"suggested_question\": \"Wer ist heute verfügbar?\"\n}\n\nI need to make sure that the \"urgency\" is null because the question doesn't indicate emergency or planned.

The user provided the input \"Mostra il turno di domani sera\" and wants me to parse it into the specified JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The keywords here are \"Mostra il turno\" which translates to \"Show the shift\" in English. Looking at the classification rules, the closest is \"view_schedule\" because \"show\" is part of that category. So the intent is likely view_schedule.\n\nNext, the entities. The main entity here is \"shift_day\" which is \"domani sera\" meaning \"tomorrow evening\". The day part is \"domani\" which maps to \"tomorrow\" in the format specified. The time is \"sera\" which is \"Evening\" as per the rules. \n\nThe other entities like employee_name, optimization_preference, time_period, and urgency are all null because there's no mention of an employee's name, optimization preferences, time period other than \"tomorrow\", and urgency isn't specified. The urgency is \"planned\" because \"sera\" is part of the time period, but the classification rules mention \"planned\" for planning words. Wait, the urgency rules say \"emergency\" for \"can't work\", \"sick\", etc., and \"planned\" for planning words. But the input doesn't mention anything about urgency, so maybe it's null. However, the time_period is \"tomorrow\", which is part of the \"time_period\" entity. \n\nThe confidence is 0.0-1.0. Since the intent is clear and the entities are all null except for the time_period, the confidence might be 0.0. But maybe it's 1.0 if the time_period is correctly identified. Wait, the time_period is \"tomorrow\" which is one of the options. So the confidence would be 1.0.\n\nMissing_info is an empty list because all required entities are present except for employee_name, optimization_preference, and urgency, which are null. The suggested_question would be \"Question or null\", but since the input is a command to show the shift, maybe the suggested question is \"What is the schedule for tomorrow evening?\" but the input is \"Mostra il turno di domani sera\", so the suggested question might be \"Show the schedule for tomorrow evening.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the intent as view_schedule, entities with shift_day as tomorrow, shift_time as evening, time_period as tomorrow, and the rest as null.

      "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this task. The input is the sentence \"Swap Anna and Felix for Friday shifts.\" I need to parse this into the specified JSON format.\n\nFirst, the intent. The action here is \"swap\" which falls under \"modify_schedule\" as per the classification rules. The intent is \"modify_schedule\".\n\nNext, the entities. The employee names are Anna and Felix. Since the sentence mentions swapping them, the entities should include both names. The shift day is Friday, which maps to \"Friday\" in the entities. The shift time is \"for Friday shifts,\" but the time period isn't specified here. The optimization preference isn't mentioned either. The urgency is \"emergency\" because it's a swap, but the original instruction says \"swap\" is part of modify_schedule, and the urgency might be \"planned\" if it's a regular swap. Wait, the classification rules for emergency_replacement include \"swap\" as emergency, but the urgency in the output is \"emergency\" or \"planned\". Since the sentence doesn't explicitly say it's an emergency, maybe it's \"planned\". But the original instruction says \"swap\" is part of modify_schedule, and the urgency might be \"planned\" unless specified otherwise. Hmm, the user's example might have \"emergency\" for swap, but I need to check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the classification rules, emergency_replacement includes \"replace\", \"cover\", \"emergency\". So if the action is a swap, maybe it's considered emergency. But the urgency in the output is \"emergency\" or \"planned\". The original sentence doesn't mention urgency, so maybe it's \"planned\" because it's a regular swap. Wait, the classification rules for \"emergency_replacement\" are when the request is about replacing someone who can't work. But the input here is a swap, which might not be an emergency. So maybe the urgency is \"planned\" since it's a regular swap. But the user's example might have \"emergency\" for swap. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The instruction says to map \"emergency\" to \"emergency_replacement\" and \"planned\" to \"modify_schedule\". Wait, the classification rules for \"modify_schedule\" includes \"swap\" as part of the intent, and the urgency is \"planned\" if it's a regular swap. So maybe the urgency is \"planned\".\n\nSo the urgency is \"planned\" because it's a regular swap, not an emergency. But the original instruction says \"swap\" is part of modify_schedule, and the urgency is \"emergency\" if it's an emergency. Since the input doesn't mention emergency, it's \"planned\".\n\nNow, the shift day is Friday, which is mapped to \"Friday\" in the entities. The shift time is \"for Friday shifts\", but the time period isn't specified. The time_period is \"this_week\" or \"next_week\" or \"today\" or \"tomorrow\". Since the input doesn't mention a specific time period, it's null. The optimization preference is null because the input doesn't mention it. The employee_name is Anna and Felix, but the entities are \"employee_name\" and \"shift_day\" and \"shift_time\". Wait, the entities include \"employee_name\" as a list, but the input mentions two names. So the entities would have both Anna and Felix as employee_name, but the JSON structure might have them as a list. However, the output format shows \"employee_name\" as a single string. Wait, the output format says \"entities\" with \"employee_name\" as a string. So maybe it's a list, but the example shows \"Anna\" as the value. Wait, the example in the output format shows \"employee_name\": \"Name or null\", so if there are multiple names, it's a list. But the input has two names, so maybe the entities would have both. But the JSON structure might have them as a list. However, the user's example shows \"employee_name\": \"Anna\" as a single string. Wait, the user's example shows \"employee_name\": \"Anna\" but the input has two names. So maybe the entities are \"employee_name\" as a list, but the output format shows it as a single string. Hmm, the user's instruction says \"entities\" with \"employee_name\" as a string. So perhaps the input has two names, but the entities are combined into one string. But the input is \"Swap Anna and Felix for Friday shifts\", so the employee names are Anna and Felix. So the entities would have \"employee_name\": \"Anna and Felix\" or \"Anna, Felix\"? But the output format says \"employee_name\" is a string. So maybe it's \"Anna and Felix\".\n\nBut the classification rules for \"modify_schedule\" include \"swap\" which is part of the intent. The urgency is \"planned\" as discussed. The shift_day is \"Friday\", shift_time is \"for Friday shifts\", but the time_period isn't specified. So the time_period is null. The optimization_preference is null. The confidence is 0.0-1.0, but since the input is a clear swap, maybe confidence is 1.0. The missing_info would be the time_period and optimization_preference, but the input doesn't mention them. Wait, the input says \"for Friday shifts\", which might imply the time period is \"this_week\" or \"next_week\". But the input doesn't specify, so the time_period is null. Similarly, optimization_preference is null.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"modify_schedule\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": \"Anna and Felix\",\n    \"shift_day\": \"Friday\",\n    \"shift_time\": \"Morning\",\n    \"optimization_preference\": null,\n    \"time_period\": null,\n    \"urgency\": \"planned\"\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"missing_info\": [\"optimization_preference\", \"time_period\"],\n  \"suggested_question\": \"What is the time period for this swap?\"\n}\n\nWait, the shift_time is \"for Friday shifts\", but the time period isn't specified. The shift_time is \"Morning\", \"Afternoon\", \"Evening\", \"Night\" or null. The input says \"for Friday shifts\", which might imply the time period is \"this_week\" or \"next_week\". But since the input doesn't specify, the time_period is null. The shift_time is not specified, so it's null. Wait, the shift_time is \"for Friday shifts\", but the time period is not specified. So the shift_time is not specified, so it's null. But the user's example shows \"shift_time\" as \"Morning\" if the time is \"8-16\". But in this case, the input doesn't specify the time, so it's null. So the shift_time is null.\n\nSo the entities would have:\n\n\"employee_name\": \"Anna and Felix\",\n\"shift_day\": \"Friday\",\n\"shift_time\": null,\n\"optimization_preference\": null,\n\"time_period\": null,\n\"urgency\": \"planned\"\n\nBut the user's example shows \"shift_time\" as \"Morning\" if the time is \"8-16\".

Similarly, shift_time is \"Evening\".\n\nThe urgency is \"planned\" because the text is about analyzing the impact, which is a planned action. So urgency is \"planned\".\n\nOther entities like employee_name and optimization_preference aren't mentioned, so they are null. Time_period is not specified, so null. Confidence is 0.0 since there's no clear info.\n\nThe suggested question would be \"What is the impact of adding an extra evening shift?\" but the input doesn't have a question, so maybe it's null.\n\nWait, the input is \"Analyze the impact of adding an extra evening shift\". The user might be asking a question, but the output requires \"suggested_question\" to be \"Question or null\". Since the input is a statement, maybe the suggested question is the same as the input. But the user's instruction says the input is the text to analyze, so the suggested question would be the question that the input is asking. However, the input is a statement, not a question. So maybe the suggested question is null? Or perhaps the input is the question, so the suggested question is the input. But the output format says \"Question or null\". Since the input is a statement, maybe the suggested question is null. Hmm, but the user's example output has \"suggested_question\": \"Question or null\". So if the input is a question, then it's the question. But the input is \"Analyze the impact...\", which is a statement. So maybe the suggested question is null. But the user's example output has \"Question or null\" as a possible value. So perhaps the suggested question is null here.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nintent: analyze_scenario\nentities: employee_name: null, shift_day: null, shift_time: Evening, optimization_preference: null, time_period: null, urgency: planned\nconfidence: 0.0\nmissing_info: [\"employee_name\", \"shift_day\", \"optimization_preference\", \"time_period\"]\nsuggested_question: null\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"analyze_scenario\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": null,\n    \"shift_day\": null,\n    \"shift_time\": \"Evening\",\n    \"optimization_preference\": null,\n    \"time_period\": null,\n    \"urgency\": \"planned\"\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"missing_info\": [\"employee_name\", \"shift_day\", \"optimization_preference\", \"time_period\"],\n  \"suggested_question\": null\n}",

The input is \"Anna-Maria kann nur sonntags von 8-16 Uhr mit Kellner-Fähigkeiten\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the components of the input. The main elements here are the employee's name, the day, time, and the optimization preference. The key here is to extract each part according to the classification rules and entity extraction guidelines.\n\nStarting with the intent. The sentence mentions \"kann nur sonntags von 8-16 Uhr mit Kellner-Fähigkeiten\". The word \"kann\" means \"can\", but the main action here is about scheduling. The intent is likely related to creating a schedule, but the exact classification needs to be checked. The rules mention \"create_schedule\" if there's a \"create\", \"build\", \"optimize\", etc. Since the input doesn't explicitly say \"create\", but the action is about scheduling, maybe the intent is \"create_schedule\" because the person is setting up a schedule. However, the presence of \"mit Kellner-Fähigkeiten\" (with kitchen skills) might indicate that it's an optimization preference. Wait, the optimization preference is \"cost\", \"preference\", \"training\", \"balanced\". The user is specifying the skills, which might relate to the optimization. But the main action is scheduling, so maybe the intent is \"create_schedule\".\n\nNext, the entities. Let's break down the input:\n\n- Employee name: Anna-Maria. According to the rules, names should be capitalized, so \"Anna-Maria\".\n- Shift day: \"sonntags\" which is Sunday. So \"shift_day\" is \"Sunday\".\n- Shift time: \"von 8-16 Uhr\". The time period is 8-16, which is \"Morning\" (since 8-12 is morning, 12-16 is afternoon, but 8-16 is evening? Wait, the rules say \"Morning\", \"Afternoon\", \"Evening\", \"Night\". 8-16 is from 8 AM to 4 PM, which is evening. So \"shift_time\" is \"Evening\".\n- Optimization preference: The user mentions \"mit Kellner-Fähigkeiten\" which translates to \"with kitchen skills\". The rules mention \"optimization_preference\" as \"cost\", \"preference\", \"training\", \"balanced\". Since the user is specifying the skills, maybe it's a preference. But the exact classification is tricky. The rules say \"preference\" if the user is choosing between options. However, the input doesn't explicitly say \"preference\", but the presence of the skills might indicate that the optimization is based on those skills. But according to the rules, the optimization preference is a separate entity. Since the user is specifying the skills, maybe it's a \"preference\" because they are choosing to have those skills. So \"optimization_preference\" would be \"preference\".\n- Time period: The input doesn't mention \"this_week\", \"next_week\", etc. So \"time_period\" is null.\n- Urgency: The sentence doesn't mention \"emergency\" or \"planned\". So \"urgency\" is null.\n\nConfidence: Since the input is about scheduling a specific shift with specific skills, the confidence might be 0.8 or 0.9. But the exact value is between 0 and 1.0.\n\nMissing info: The time period is not specified, so it's in the missing_info array.\n\nSuggested question: The user might be asking to create a schedule for Anna-Maria on Sunday from 8-16 with kitchen skills. So the suggested question could be \"Create a schedule for Anna-Maria on Sunday from 8-16 with kitchen skills.\"\n\nPutting it all together into the JSON structure as per the output format.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"create_schedule\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": \"Anna-Maria\",\n    \"shift_day\": \"Sunday\",\n    \"shift_time\": \"Evening\",\n    \"optimization_preference\": \"preference\",\n    \"time_period\": \"this_week\",\n    \"urgency\": \"planned\"\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"missing_info\": [\"time_period\"],\n  \"suggested_question\": \"Create a schedule for Anna-Maria on Sunday from 8-16 with kitchen skills.\"\n}",
