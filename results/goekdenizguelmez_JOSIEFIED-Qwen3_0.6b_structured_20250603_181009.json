The user provided the input \"Wer ist heute verfügbar?\" which translates to \"Who is available today?\" and wants it parsed into a JSON structure. \n\nFirst, I need to check the classification rules. The input doesn't mention anything about scheduling, so the intent is probably \"information\" or \"view_schedule\". But looking at the rules, \"view_schedule\" is listed as a possible intent. However, the input is a question about availability, which might be a search for available employees. \n\nThe entities required are employee_name, shift_day, shift_time, optimization_preference, time_period, urgency. The input is a question, so maybe the answer is that no one is available today. But the output format needs to have the JSON structure. \n\nWait, the input is \"Wer ist heute verfügbar?\" which is asking who is available today. The output should reflect that. The intent here is \"information\" because it's about listing available employees. The entities would include the employee name as \"Name or null\", shift_day as \"today\", shift_time as \"null\", etc. \n\nI need to make sure that the output is in JSON format as specified. Also, check if any missing_info is present. Since the input is a question, maybe there's no missing info. The suggested question would be \"Question or null\" as the input. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the intent as \"information\", entities with the correct fields, and the confidence as 0.0. The missing_info list is empty. The output should be in JSON only, no text.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"information\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": \"Name or null\",\n    \"shift_day\": \"today\",\n    \"shift_time\": \"null\",\n    \"optimization_preference\": \"null\",\n    \"time_period\": \"today\",\n    \"urgency\": \"null\"\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"missing_info\": [],\n  \"suggested_question\": \"Question or null\"\n}",

The user provided the input sentence: \"What if we move Sarah from Monday morning to Tuesday afternoon?\" and wants it parsed into a JSON format as specified.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input into the required fields. Let's start with the intent. The input mentions moving a shift, so the intent is likely \"modify_schedule\". \n\nNext, the entities. The employee name is Sarah, so I'll capitalize it as \"Sarah\". The shift day is Monday, which maps to \"Monday\". The shift time is \"Morning\" and \"Afternoon\". The optimization preference isn't specified, so \"null\". The time period is \"this_week\" since it's a week-long shift. The urgency is \"emergency\" because it's a hypothetical scenario. \n\nI need to check the rules again. The intent is correct here. The entities are all filled out. The confidence is 1.0 since everything seems to fit. Missing info is empty. The suggested question is \"Question or null\" as the input is a scenario. \n\nWait, the output format requires \"suggested_question\" as a string. The input is a question, so maybe that's part of the missing info? Or is it included as a null? The user's example output shows \"suggested_question\" as a string. Since the input is a question, maybe that's part of the missing info. But the output format says \"suggested_question\" is a string. So I'll include that as \"Question or null\". \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the intent, entities, confidence, missing info, and suggested question. All fields are correctly filled out according to the rules. I think that's all.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"modify_schedule\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": \"Sarah\",\n    \"shift_day\": \"Monday\",\n    \"shift_time\": \"Morning\",\n    \"optimization_preference\": \"null\",\n    \"time_period\": \"this_week\",\n    \"urgency\": \"emergency\"\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"missing_info\": [],\n  \"suggested_question\": \"Question or null\"\n}",
