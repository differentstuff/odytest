The action here is \"kann nicht arbeiten\" which translates to \"can't work\". That's an emergency because she's sick. So the intent is emergency_replacement.\n\nStep 2: Extract the person's name.

So the first step is to identify the main action as \"create_schedule\".\n\nNext, extract person names. The input mentions \"optimizing for cost\", but there's no explicit mention of a person's name. So maybe the person is the user or the entity involved. But in the example, they used \"Anna\" as the employee. Since there's no specific person here, maybe the entities are empty? Wait, the example had \"employee_name\": null. So maybe in this case, the person is the user or the entity, but since there's no specific name, we leave it as null.\n\nThen, find time references. The input is about a schedule for the next week, but there's no specific time mentioned. The example had \"shift_day\" and \"shift_time\". So here, the time reference is the next week, but the exact time isn't specified. So time_period would be \"next week\".\n\nDetect urgency signals. The input is \"Create next week's schedule optimizing for cost\". The word \"optimizing for cost\" suggests that there's a cost optimization involved. But does that indicate urgency? Maybe not directly. In the example, urgency was \"emergency\". So maybe here, urgency is not directly clear, so leave it as null.\n\nDetermine missing information.

So the main action here is to find who is available.\n\nNext, extract proper nouns. The input is in German, so \"Wer\" is the person's name. But the output JSON requires the employee_name to be a proper noun. Since there's no specific person mentioned, maybe leave it as null. Then, find time references. The input is \"today\", which is a time reference. So shift_day would be \"today\".\n\nDetect urgency signals. The input is a general question, not urgent. So urgency is not set. Missing information is the time reference, which is \"today\". The JSON output needs to have entities with those fields. The confidence is 0.0 as per the example, so that's okay. Missing info is [\"today\"], and the suggested question is \"What time is today available?\".\n\nPutting it all together, the final JSON should have the intent as view_schedule or similar, but since the input is about availability, maybe emergency_replacement.
