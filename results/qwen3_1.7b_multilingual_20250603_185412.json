The user provided the input \"Anna can't work Friday evening, who can replace her?\" and wants the JSON output based on the given format.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The keywords here are \"can't work\" and \"replace her.\" From the Intents list, \"emergency_replacement\" seems fitting because it's about someone not being able to work and needing a replacement. The intent is likely \"emergency_replacement.\"\n\nNext, the entities. The employee name is Anna, the shift day is Friday evening. The urgency is emergency since it's about not being able to work. The shift time is \"evening,\" but the entities might not need that if it's part of the shift day. Wait, the entities include \"shift_day\" and \"shift_time.\" Since the input mentions \"Friday evening,\" maybe both are present. But the example shows \"Friday\" as shift_day and \"evening\" as shift_time. However, the user's input has \"Friday evening,\" so maybe both are present. But in the example given, \"Friday\" is the day, and \"evening\" is the time. So perhaps both are needed. But the entities in the example have \"shift_day\" as \"Friday\" and \"shift_time\" as \"evening.\" So maybe here, the shift_day is \"Friday\" and shift_time is \"evening.\"\n\nThen, the confidence. Since the input is clear about Anna not working on Friday evening and asking who can replace her, the confidence should be high, maybe 0.9.\n\nMissing info: The input does mention the employee name and the shift day and time, so maybe there's no missing info. But the example shows that sometimes missing info is present. Wait, in the example, \"Sarah ist krank\" had missing info for shift_day and shift_time. But here, the input does include the shift day and time. So maybe no missing info.\n\nThe suggested question would be \"Which shift can't Anna work?\" or similar. But the example shows the suggested question as \"Which shift can't Sarah work?\" So maybe here, the suggested question is \"Which shift can Anna work?\" but the input is about replacement, so maybe \"Who can replace Anna on Friday evening?\" but the user's input is \"who can replace her?\" so the suggested question would be \"Who can replace Anna on Friday evening?\"\n\nBut the user's input is \"Anna can't work Friday evening, who can replace her?\" So the suggested question would be \"Who can replace Anna on Friday evening?\" but the example shows the suggested question as \"Which shift can't Sarah work?\" So maybe the suggested question is \"Who can replace Anna on Friday evening?\"\n\nBut the user's input is in English, so the suggested question would be \"Who can replace Anna on Friday evening?\" but the example shows the suggested question as \"Which shift can't Sarah work?\" So maybe the suggested question is \"Who can replace Anna on Friday evening?\"\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have intent \"emergency_replacement\", entities with employee_name \"Anna\", shift_day \"Friday\", shift_time \"evening\", urgency \"emergency\", confidence 0.9, missing_info empty, suggested_question \"Who can replace Anna on Friday evening?\" and conversation_hint null.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"emergency_replacement\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": \"Anna\",\n    \"shift_day\": \"Friday\",\n    \"shift_time\": \"evening\",\n    \"urgency\": \"emergency\"\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"missing_info\": [],\n  \"suggested_question\": \"Who can replace Anna on Friday evening?\",\n  \"conversation_hint\": null\n}",

The user wants to parse the input \"Wer ist heute verfügbar?\" into JSON based on the provided intents and examples.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent.

The other intents like emergency_replacement or create_schedule don't fit here.\n\nNext, the entities. The user is asking about availability, so the relevant entity here is \"employee_name\" and \"shift_day\" (today). But since the input doesn't mention specific names or shifts, those will be null. The confidence should be low since there's missing info, like the exact employee name or shift time.\n\nLooking at the examples, when there's no specific info, the confidence is 0.0. So here, the confidence would be 0.0. The missing_info array would include \"employee_name\" and \"shift_time\" because the input doesn't specify them.\n\nThe suggested_question would be something like \"Which employees are available today?\" but since the example shows the user's input, maybe it's left as null. The conversation_hint could be a suggestion to provide more details, but the example doesn't have that, so it's null.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the intent as \"view_schedule\", entities with null values for the missing fields, confidence 0.0, and the missing_info array including the missing entities.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"view_schedule\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": null,\n    \"shift_day\": \"heute\",\n    \"shift_time\": null,\n    \"shift_name\": null,\n    \"optimization_preference\": null,\n    \"time_period\": null,\n    \"urgency\": null\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"missing_info\": [\"employee_name\", \"shift_time\"],\n  \"suggested_question\": \"Which employees are available today?\",\n  \"conversation_hint\": \"Provide specific employee names or shift times for better accuracy.\"\n}",

The confidence is set to 0.0 as there's no information provided. The missing_info array would include any required fields that aren't present.

The input is \"Anna-Maria kann nur sonntags von 8-16 Uhr mit Kellner-Fähigkeiten\". \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The keywords here are \"kann nur sonntags von 8-16 Uhr mit Kellner-Fähigkeiten\". The intent options include emergency_replacement, which relates to someone being unable to work. Since the input mentions Anna-Maria can't work on Sunday from 8-16, the intent should be emergency_replacement. \n\nNext, the entities. The employee name is Anna-Maria. The shift day is Sunday, the time period is 8-16 Uhr, and the optimization preference is \"Kellner-Fähigkeiten\" which translates to \"Waiter Skills\". However, in the JSON structure, the entities have fields like \"optimization_preference\" and \"shift_name\". Since \"Kellner-Fähigkeiten\" is a specific skill, maybe it's better to map it to \"optimization_preference\". The shift day is Sunday, so \"shift_day\" should be \"Sonntag\". The time period is from 8 to 16, so \"time_period\" would be \"08:00-16:00\". \n\nThe confidence level needs to be set. Since the input is clear and specific, maybe 0.9 is appropriate. The missing_info array should include any missing fields. In this case, there's no missing info because all required entities are present. \n\nThe suggested_question and conversation_hint are null because there's no need for them here. \n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have the intent as emergency_replacement, entities with employee_name, shift_day, time_period, and optimization_preference, confidence 0.9, and missing_info empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"emergency_replacement\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": \"Anna-Maria\",\n    \"shift_day\": \"Sonntag\",\n    \"shift_time\": \"08:00-16:00\",\n    \"optimization_preference\": \"Kellner-Fähigkeiten\",\n    \"time_period\": \"08:00-16:00\",\n    \"urgency\": \"emergency\"\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"missing_info\": [],\n  \"suggested_question\": null,\n  \"conversation_hint\": null\n}",

      "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to parse the input \"Schedule meeting for 3pm tomorrow\" into JSON with the specified format. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. The keywords here are \"schedule\" and \"meeting\". The intent options include \"view_schedule\", \"create_schedule\", etc. Since the action is to schedule a meeting, the intent should be \"create_schedule\" because it's about creating a schedule. But looking at the examples, \"create_schedule\" is when you build or generate a schedule. However, the input is more about setting a specific time, so maybe \"view_schedule\" is also possible. Wait, the user is scheduling a meeting, so it's an action to create a schedule. So \"create_schedule\" makes sense here.\n\nNext, the entities. The main entity here is the time, which is \"3pm tomorrow\". The \"shift_day\" would be \"tomorrow\", but the input doesn't specify a day name. The \"shift_time\" would be \"3pm\". The \"time_period\" might be \"tomorrow\" as the day. However, the JSON structure requires \"shift_day\" and \"shift_time\" to be present. Since the input doesn't mention a specific day, maybe \"shift_day\" is null. Similarly, \"shift_name\" isn't mentioned. The \"urgency\" isn't specified either. So the entities would have \"shift_time\" as \"3pm\" and \"shift_day\" as \"tomorrow\", but the user might not have provided the day, so maybe it's null. Wait, the example given in the problem has \"shift_day\" as \"Friday\" when the input is \"Anna can't work Friday\". So if the input is \"tomorrow\", then \"shift_day\" would be \"tomorrow\", but the example shows that if the day isn't specified, it's considered missing. However, in this case, the input does mention \"tomorrow\", so \"shift_day\" should be \"tomorrow\". But the user's input is \"Schedule meeting for 3pm tomorrow\", so the day is \"tomorrow\". So \"shift_day\" is \"tomorrow\", \"shift_time\" is \"3pm\".\n\nThe confidence level is 0.0 initially, but since the intent is clear, maybe 0.9? But the example shows 0.9 for \"emergency_replacement\" when the day is specified. However, in this case, the day is mentioned, so maybe confidence is 0.9. But the user's input doesn't specify the day in the same way as the example. Wait, the input is \"Schedule meeting for 3pm tomorrow\", which includes the day. So the entities would have \"shift_day\" as \"tomorrow\" and \"shift_time\" as \"3pm\". The confidence would be 0.9 because the information is present.\n\nMissing info would be any fields not provided. In this case, \"employee_name\" is not mentioned, so it's null. \"shift_name\" is not specified, so null. \"optimization_preference\" is null. So the missing_info array would be [\"employee_name\", \"shift_name\"].\n\nThe suggested_question would be something like \"What time is the meeting scheduled?\" but the example shows \"Which shift can't Sarah work?\" So maybe \"What time is the meeting scheduled?\" but the user's input is about scheduling a meeting, so maybe the suggested question is \"What time is the meeting scheduled?\" but the example shows a different structure. However, the user's input doesn't have the employee name, so the suggested question might be \"Who is scheduling the meeting?\" but the example shows \"Which shift can't Sarah work?\" So perhaps the suggested question is \"What time is the meeting scheduled?\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have intent \"create_schedule\", entities with shift_day as \"tomorrow\", shift_time as \"3pm\", confidence 0.9, missing_info as [\"employee_name\", \"shift_name\"], and suggested_question as \"What time is the meeting scheduled?\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"create_schedule\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": null,\n    \"shift_day\": \"tomorrow\",\n    \"shift_time\": \"3pm\",\n    \"shift_name\": null,\n    \"optimization_preference\": null,\n    \"time_period\": \"tomorrow\",\n    \"urgency\": null\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"missing_info\": [\"employee_name\", \"shift_name\"],\n  \"suggested_question\": \"What time is the meeting scheduled?\",\n  \"conversation_hint\": null\n}",
