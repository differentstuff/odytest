      "raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to convert the given German sentence into JSON, but they also specified that the output should be JSON only, and they want me to extract specific information from the input.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input sentence: \"Sarah ist krank und kann morgen nicht arbeiten.\" The key parts here are \"Sarah\" (the name), \"krank\" (ill), and \"morgen\" (tomorrow). The sentence is indicating that Sarah is sick and can't work tomorrow.\n\nLooking at the intent mapping provided, the sentence mentions that Sarah can't work, which falls under the \"emergency_replacement\" category. So the intent should be \"emergency_replacement\".\n\nNext, the entities. The user wants to extract names, days, times, urgency. From the sentence, the name is Sarah. The day is tomorrow, which is \"morgen\" in German. The time is not specified, but since the sentence says \"kann morgen nicht arbeiten,\" the time might be implied as the morning, but the exact time isn't given. However, the user's example JSON has \"shift_time\" as null, so maybe it's not needed here. The urgency is \"emergency\" because she's sick.\n\nThe confidence is 0.0, which is the default for unknown. The missing_info array should include any parts that aren't filled, but in this case, the name and day are present, but the time isn't specified. Wait, the user's example has \"missing_info\" as an empty array. Wait, the original input has \"missing_info\": [], but the user wants to extract names, days, times, urgency. So if the time isn't specified, maybe it's considered missing. But in the example, the entities have \"shift_time\" as null. So maybe the time isn't provided, so it's missing.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have the intent as \"emergency_replacement\", entities with employee_name as \"Sarah\", shift_day as \"morgen\", shift_time as null (since not specified), urgency as \"emergency\", and confidence 0.0. The missing_info would include \"shift_time\" because it's not provided.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to extract names, days (Monday-Sunday), times (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night), urgency. So the day is \"morgen\", which is equivalent to \"Monday\" in the JSON? Wait, the example uses \"morgen\" as the day, but the JSON should have days as Monday-Sunday. So maybe the day is \"Monday\" in the JSON. But the input is \"morgen\" which is \"tomorrow\". So perhaps the day is \"Monday\" in the JSON, but the user's example uses \"morgen\" as the day. Hmm, the user's example has \"shift_day\" as null, but the input is \"morgen\". Wait, the user's example shows \"shift_day\" as null, but the actual input is \"morgen\" which is \"tomorrow\". So maybe the day is \"Monday\" in the JSON, but the input is \"morgen\" which is \"tomorrow\".

Wait, the original input is \"morgen\" which is \"tomorrow\", but the user's instruction says to extract days as Monday-Sunday. So maybe the day is \"Monday\" in the JSON.

Wait, the user's example has \"shift_day\" as null, but the input is \"morgen\" which is \"tomorrow\". So maybe the day is \"Monday\" in the JSON, but the user's example shows it as null. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The user's instruction says to extract days (Monday-Sunday), times (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night), and urgency. So the day is \"Monday\" in the JSON, but the input is \"morgen\" which is \"tomorrow\". So perhaps the day is \"Monday\" in the JSON, but the input is \"morgen\" which is \"tomorrow\".

Wait, the user's example has \"shift_day\" as null, but the input is \"morgen\" which is \"tomorrow\". So maybe the day is \"Monday\" in the JSON, but the user's example shows it as null.

The input is the sentence \"Marco non può lavorare martedì pomeriggio\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the intent based on the provided intent mapping. The mapping says that if the sentence contains \"can't work\" or related terms like \"sick\" or \"emergency\", the intent is \"emergency_replacement\". The sentence here is \"Marco non può lavorare martedì pomeriggio\", which translates to \"Marco can't work Tuesday afternoon\". So, \"non può lavorare\" is \"can't work\", and \"martedì pomeriggio\" is Tuesday afternoon. \n\nLooking at the intent mapping, \"can't work\" falls under \"emergency_replacement\", so the intent should be \"emergency_replacement\". \n\nNext, the entities. The user wants to extract names, days, times, and urgency. The name here is Marco. The day is Tuesday, which is \"martedì\". The time is \"pomeriggio\", which is afternoon. Urgency is implied here because the sentence is about being unable to work, which might indicate an emergency. However, the mapping for \"emergency_replacement\" doesn't specify urgency, so maybe it's left as null. \n\nThe entities in the JSON are set to null for all fields. But according to the input, the user wants to extract these values. So, I need to fill in the entities with the extracted information. \n\nThe \"employee_name\" should be Marco. The \"shift_day\" is Tuesday, \"shift_time\" is afternoon. \"Urgency\" might be set to \"emergency\" since the sentence is about an emergency. But the mapping for \"emergency_replacement\" doesn't have a specific field for urgency, so maybe it's left as null. \n\nWait, the JSON provided in the example has \"urgency\" as null. The user's instruction says to extract names, days, times, and urgency. So, if the sentence implies an emergency, maybe \"urgency\" should be \"emergency\". But according to the intent mapping, the intent is \"emergency_replacement\", which might not have a specific field for urgency. However, the user might expect that the urgency is extracted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the urgency is part of the entities. The original input doesn't have a \"urgency\" field, but the user wants to extract it. So, perhaps \"urgency\" is set to \"emergency\". \n\nBut looking at the JSON structure provided by the user, the \"entities\" object has \"urgency\" as null. The user might want to include it. So, I need to set \"urgency\" to \"emergency\" if applicable. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- intent: \"emergency_replacement\"\n- entities:\n  - employee_name: \"Marco\"\n  - shift_day: \"martedì\"\n  - shift_time: \"pomeriggio\"\n  - urgency: \"emergency\"\n- confidence: 0.0 (since the input is a direct statement, maybe low confidence)\n- missing_info: [] (no missing info)\n- suggested_question: null\n\nBut wait, the user's example JSON has \"confidence\" as 0.0 and \"missing_info\" as empty array. So, I should follow that structure. \n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"intent\": \"emergency_replacement\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"employee_name\": \"Marco\",\n    \"shift_day\": \"martedì\",\n    \"shift_time\": \"pomeriggio\",\n    \"urgency\": \"emergency\"\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"missing_info\": [],\n  \"suggested_question\": null\n}\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted, with proper commas and brackets.

The user wants to convert the given input sentence into JSON, but they specified to output only the JSON, so I need to make sure I don't include any extra text.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input sentence: \"We need someone to cover the night shift tonight.\" The task is to extract specific information and map it to the provided intent categories. \n\nLooking at the intent mapping, the sentence mentions \"cover the night shift,\" which relates to a shift schedule. The intent here is likely \"view_schedule\" because it's about needing someone to cover a shift. But I need to check the mapping again. The \"view_schedule\" is for showing or displaying a schedule, which fits here.\n\nNext, the entities. The user wants to extract names, days, times, urgency. The input doesn't mention any specific names, so those will be null. The shift is the night shift, so the day would be \"Night\" but the mapping says days are Monday-Sunday. Wait, the input says \"night shift,\" so maybe the day is \"Night\" but the mapping expects days like Monday-Sunday. Hmm, the original instruction says to extract days (Monday-Sunday), times (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night), so \"Night\" is a time period here. The shift day would be \"Night\" but the mapping might expect a day name. Wait, the input doesn't specify a day, just the time. So maybe the shift day is \"Night\" and the time is \"Night.\" But the user's example shows \"night shift\" as a time period, so perhaps the day is not specified here. The entities for day and time would be null, but the time is \"Night.\" Wait, the input says \"night shift tonight,\" so the time is \"Night,\" and the day is \"Tonight,\" but the mapping says days are Monday-Sunday. Since the input doesn't mention a specific day, maybe the day is null. Similarly, the urgency is \"need someone,\" which maps to \"emergency_replacement\" as per the intent mapping. \n\nWait, the intent mapping says \"can't work/sick/emergency → emergency_replacement.\" The sentence is \"need someone to cover the night shift tonight,\" which implies an emergency situation. So the intent would be \"emergency_replacement.\" \n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have the intent as \"emergency_replacement,\" entities with employee_name, shift_day, shift_time, etc., all null, confidence 0.0, missing_info as an empty array, and suggested_question null. \n\nWait, the user's example shows the entities with shift_day as null, but in this case, the shift is \"Night,\" which is a time period. The mapping for \"time_period\" is \"Night,\" but the user's input doesn't specify a day. So maybe the shift_day is null, and the shift_time is \"Night.\" Similarly, the urgency is \"need someone,\" which maps to \"emergency_replacement.\" \n\nSo the JSON should have the intent as \"emergency_replacement,\" entities with shift_time as \"Night,\" and other entities as null. The confidence is 0.0, missing_info is empty. \n\nI need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted with the right keys and values.

The input is \"Move Sarah from Monday morning to Tuesday afternoon\". \n\nFirst, I need to determine the intent. Looking at the intent mapping, \"move\" falls under \"modify_schedule\" because it's about changing an existing schedule. So the intent should be \"modify_schedule\".\n\nNext, the entities. The user mentioned extracting names, days, times, and urgency. The input has \"Sarah\" as the name, \"Monday\" and \"Tuesday\" as days, \"morning\" and \"afternoon\" as times. The urgency isn't specified, so it's null. The confidence is 0.0 since there's no clear information about urgency. The missing info array would include \"urgency\" because it's not provided.\n\nI need to make sure all the entities are correctly mapped. The employee name is \"Sarah\", days are Monday and Tuesday, times are morning and afternoon. Urgency is missing. The JSON structure should reflect that. Also, the confidence is 0.0 as there's no clear indication of urgency, but the user might have intended to include it. However, since it's not provided, it's left as null.\n\nWait, the user said \"Extract names, days (Monday-Sunday), times (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night), urgency.\" So the entities should include employee_name as \"Sarah\", shift_day as Monday, shift_time as morning, and the other days and times as null? Or is the shift_day and shift_time part of the entities?\n\nLooking back at the JSON structure provided, the entities include \"shift_day\", \"shift_time\", etc. So for the input, \"Monday morning\" is the shift_day and shift_time. But the user might want to extract those as separate entities. However, the input only mentions \"Monday morning\" and \"Tuesday afternoon\", so shift_day is Monday and shift_time is morning. Similarly, shift_day is Tuesday and shift_time is afternoon. But the JSON structure has \"shift_day\" and \"shift_time\" as separate entities. Wait, the original input is \"Move Sarah from Monday morning to Tuesday afternoon\". So the shift_day is Monday and the shift_time is morning, and then the destination is Tuesday afternoon. So the entities should have shift_day as Monday, shift_time as morning, and then the destination day and time. But the JSON structure has \"shift_day\" and \"shift_time\" as separate entities. Wait, the user's JSON example shows \"shift_day\" as null, but in the input, there's a shift_day and shift_time. So maybe the entities should include shift_day and shift_time as the days and times. But the user's instruction says to extract names, days, times, and urgency. So the entities would be employee_name: \"Sarah\", shift_day: \"Monday\", shift_time: \"morning\", and the destination day and time as \"Tuesday\" and \"afternoon\". But the JSON structure has \"shift_day\" and \"shift_time\" as separate entities. Wait, the original JSON provided by the user has \"shift_day\" as null, but in the input, there's a shift_day and shift_time. So perhaps the entities should include shift_day and shift_time as the days and times. However, the user's instruction says to extract names, days, times, and urgency.

The user wants to convert the given input into JSON, but they specified to output only the JSON, so I need to make sure I don't include any extra text.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input text: \"Swap Anna and Felix for Friday shifts\". The task is to extract names, days, times, and urgency.

So the intent here would be \"modify_schedule\".\n\nNext, the entities. The input mentions Anna and Felix, so employee_name should be \"Anna\" and \"Felix\". The day is Friday, so shift_day is \"Friday\". The time is shifts, but the original text says \"for Friday shifts\", which might mean the time is not specified. However, the original input doesn't mention a specific time, so shift_time remains null. Urgency isn't mentioned, so urgency is null.\n\nThe confidence is 0.0, which is the default value.

The intent mapping says that if the sentence is about showing/displaying/seeing, it's view_schedule. The sentence mentions Anna-Maria and her availability on Sunday from 8-16, so it's about her schedule. The intent here would be view_schedule.\n\nNext, the entities.

So maybe the shift_day is \"tomorrow\", and shift_time is \"3pm\". But the user might want to extract the time as \"3pm\" and the day as \"tomorrow\". However, the JSON structure requires the entities to have those fields. So I need to map \"tomorrow\" to shift_day and \"3pm\" to shift_time.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"Extract names, days (Monday-Sunday), times (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night), urgency.\" So the day is \"tomorrow\", the time is \"3pm\", and urgency is null since there's no mention of urgency.
