The first thing to note is the entity extraction rules. The user mentioned to capitalize the first letters of names, so Sarah becomes Anna. Days are mapped to standard format, so \"Monday\" would be \"Monday\" here. Shift times are grouped into periods, so \"morgen\" translates to \"Morning\". Urgency is determined by emergency words, which here are \"krank\" and \"morgen\", so urgency is \"emergency\".\n\nNow, checking the classification rules. The intent here is to indicate that Sarah can't work, so the intent is \"emergency_replacement\". The entities are employee_name as Anna, shift_day as Monday, shift_time as Morning, optimization_preference as null, time_period as tomorrow, and urgency as emergency.

Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe intent is determined by the input. The input is \"Mike\", so looking at the classification rules, there's no specific intent here. The options are emergency_replacement, create_schedule, etc. Since \"Mike\" isn't matching any of the keywords like \"can't work\", \"sick\", \"replace\", \"cover\", \"emergency\", maybe the intent is unknown? Wait, the rules say if the input matches any, use that. Otherwise, unknown. So since \"Mike\" doesn't fit any of the intent categories, the intent should be unknown.\n\nNext, entities. The input is just \"Mike\". The entities fields are for employee_name, shift_day, etc. But there's no information about a shift, time, etc. So the entities would be empty except for the employee_name. But the input is just \"Mike\", so maybe the employee_name is \"Mike\". Let me check the rules again. The entity EXTRACTION says to capitalize first letters and map days to today, etc. So \"Mike\" becomes \"Mike\". The shift_day, time, etc., are all null. So entities would be { \"employee_name\": \"Mike\", ... }.\n\nConfidence is 0.0-1.0, but since there's no data, maybe it's 0.0. Missing_info is an empty list. Suggested_question is null. Let me make sure. The input is just a single name, so all entities are empty except for employee_name.
